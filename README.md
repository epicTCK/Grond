Compiles-to-JS golfing language 
input is always taken first thing unless the `ยง` character is at the beginning of the program    
input is stored in the variable `s` and is printed at the end of the program unless equal to the string literal `""`  
The math module can be inputted by typing the `ล` character as the first or second character of the program  
The math module simply wraps the compiled program in `with(math){ ... }`  
##Problems
- If your program contains every ASCII character, the compiler will throw and error. This is stupid and will be fixed.
- Probably a whole bunch of other problems I haven't found yet, if you find one go ahead and fix it and submit a pull request  
- My gut tells me that the code is awful, if you want to improve it *please do*
